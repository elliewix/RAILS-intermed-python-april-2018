# SQL Lesson

But maybe from a different perspective.

## Here's the scene:

* You have a speadsheet you want to do some analysis on and otherwise explore.
* You want to do more than what Excel can do, or you want to do it in a way that you can document and rerun.
* You do (or will!) know some SQL, look at the data, and think "hey these questions sound like SQL questions."
* Much of the data you want to work with are not quantitative values, and is mostly categorical, ordinal, or contains labels/descriptions.
* You may be limited to online platforms or platforms you don't have a choice over (so you either need to bypass it with a web client or you need a lesson that's platform agnostic).

This lesson is for you.

Goals:

* start with a spreadsheet
* make it into a database file that you can read into a variety of platforms (even cloud ones!)
* write some SQL queries to:
	* investigate your data
	* perform some calculations
	* transform your data
	* aggregate information
* output results files

All using approaches that:

* won't risk any changes to the original data
* leverages several free and open source tools
* is compatible with several cloud based tools in case you don't have admin rights)
* is easily compatible with reproducible practices
* works nicely with version control systems, such as git, GitHub, and GitLab
* doesn't require that you use a server or set one up to perform SQL queries
* are reasonably platform agnostic so you have a variety of choices in the tools that you use


We'll be focusing on data that in not numerical.  This means that the data we'll see, even if it looks like numbers, aren't all quantitative measurments.
