# Pandas

## Technically

From a purely technical perspective, we can describe pandas as a free and open source third party library for Python.  What the heck does that mean?

### Free and open source

* free: no cost to install and use
* open source: all the code and development of pandas is done in an open and public way.  Not only can you see all the source code behind the library, you can also contribute to it and communicate directly to the maintainer community.
* Together this means that it is released under a permissive license, such that you can use it for free, but you can also take the code and adapt all or part of it for your own needs, even commercial.  More info on the license is here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/overview.html#license and help understanding it is here:  https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised).

### Third party library for python

* third party: this is not part of the Python standard library.  This means that it is outside of the central control and support of core python, and you must install it separately of your normal Python. Many installation resources (like anaconda) will include it, so you may not need to do much more to install it.  This also means that the syntax and other tools in the pandas ecosystem are not tested or discussed within the core python community, so it may violate or do odd things compared to standard python. This isn't always a bad thing, but something to remain aware of.
* library: roughly, this means that it brings in a set of functions, data types, and classes for use as needed. There are many of each of those, and you import them in whole or part as you need them.
