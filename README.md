# Intermediate Python for Automation and Data Processing

# Description:  

This workshop will cover Python programming for file manipulation, version control, APIs with URL endpoints, and reading/writing common data formats.  We will also have sessions to help you plan and get started on a project of your choice, and discuss personal project management.  Learners will meet in the Burr Ridge office for a 1.5 day in person workshop, and an additional four weekly online sessions are included.  These online sessions will have additional interactive tutorials on topics selected by learners, and project discussion time.

This workshop presumes some basic programming exposure in Python (at least a short workshop, MOOC but not more than a full college level course), but otherwise no other programming experience is presumed.  This is aimed at learners seeking additional introductory programming experience in the medium of Python, and not for professional programmers wanting to pick up Python.  Contact the instructor with any questions about fit.

Learners will be required to bring a laptop computer capable of having PyCharm and Python installed (so no iPads or similar tablets) and power cables.  All software to be installed is free and directions will be provided before the workshop begins.  Some time will be allowed to installation help during the workshop.  Those unable to bring a computer will need to contact RAILS to make arrangements.

Learners will develop and practice their Python programming skills, understand core approaches to processing data and automating tasks, practice technical project planning, and get started on their own personal or work project.  More broadly, we will also cover how to find and evaluate learning resources, and how to self organize and manage programming projects.  Online follow up sessions will be an opportunity for learners to get additional tool exposure, and use project discussions to create a cohort and network of support for after the sessions have finished.

# Topics:

* Python installation and syntax review
* Advanced string manipulation and automation approaches
* GitHub as a solo user
* Data management
* Reading/Writing files, and working with CSVs, JSON, and other data types
* APIs
* XPath & Regular Expressions
* Project planning and setting goals


# Intended audience:  

Learners are expected to have rudimentary Python and programming exposure, but not necessarily coursework.  This is targeted at someone with no formal programming or education, and not someone fluent in another programming language wishing to pick up the language.
